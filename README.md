Library mainly designed to provide cross-version support for Minecraft Bukkit servers, but it also includes numerous extra methods to help developers design their plugins easier and efficiently.

Don't forget to add api-version: "1.13" to your plugin.yml. This will keep the plugin working even if the server is not 1.13

This project aims to provide quality utilities with high performance using the latest, yet efficient techniques. Although support for old versions (like 1.8) will still remain for future updates, I highly encourage all developers drop support for anything below 1.12
